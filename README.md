> __Description__: __`C++`__ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or __`"C with Classes"`__. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

* __Typescript__

> __Description__: __`Typescript`__ is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of __`JavaScript`__ and adds optional static typing to the language. __TypeScript__ is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As __TypeScript__ is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid __TypeScript__ programs.

* __Java__

<p>

> __Description__: __`Java`__ is a __`high-level`__, __`class-based`__, __`object-oriented programming language`__ that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any __`Java virtual machine (JVM)`__ regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

* __C\#__

> __Description__: __`C#`__ is a __`general-purpose`__, __`multi-paradigm programming language`__. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines
